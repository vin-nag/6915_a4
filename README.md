# Designing a deep neural network architecture to classify house view digits
## Project for COMP 6915 - _by Ozah Nnamdi Wilson and Vineel Nagisetty_  

We design a simple architecture of a deep learning network that can classify digits from Stanford's "Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset". Most of our code is inspired from the tutorial at: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification
